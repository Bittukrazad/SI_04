Sentiment Analysis Of Customer Reviews 

This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis model to classify customer reviews as positive, negative, or neutral using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The project uses a dataset of customer reviews and applies preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the data for model training.

Key Components:

Data Preprocessing:

The dataset includes customer reviews, ratings, and other relevant information.
Data is cleaned by removing missing values, punctuation, and stopwords. Tokenization is applied to split reviews into individual words for analysis.
The CountVectorizer from scikit-learn is used to transform textual data into numerical features suitable for modeling.

Model Selection and Training:

The project implements a Naive Bayes classifier (MultinomialNB), which is effective for text classification tasks like sentiment analysis.
The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
The model is trained on the processed text data to learn patterns associated with different sentiment levels.

Evaluation:

The modelâ€™s performance is measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
A classification report is generated to provide insights into how well the model predicts each sentiment category.
An accuracy score is calculated to quantify the overall effectiveness of the model.

This project offers a hands-on approach to developing sentiment analysis models using fundamental NLP and machine learning techniques, providing valuable insights into customer feedback and sentiments.
